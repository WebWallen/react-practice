## React/Redux Mastercourse

Repo to keep practice files and application projects (such as "Expensify" -- a budgeting/online banking type app used to enter, render, and sort expenses) from "The Complete React Developer Course w/ Hooks and Redux" by Andrew Mead. 

Note: I was already familiar with these concepts as they were taught during Lambda School, but there is definitely room for improvement, so I'm taking this course for extra practice. Feel free to scroll through additional repos to find additional projects that were completed on cross-functional teams.
